# Vac-iOS

- Vac is a langauge learning apps that help English leaners to effectively learn new words.
- Building vocabulary is a tedious process. Moreover, the general method used by most learners - looking up words in a dictionary and never look at them again - is extremely inefficient.
- Using Vac, users can look up words, create new flashcards with the press of a button, and study them anytime they want.

- Vac is currently powered by WordNik's raw API.
- I'm currently looking for an alternative dictionary source that is more reliable and accurate.
